In this lesson wetext classification model (an nlp deep learning model that predict the similarity between phrases) with hugging face transformers. ( how similar the two phrases are in meaning.
Are they the same? Similar? Or totally different? )
First we load data set from kaggle
Then with panda df data frame we display data
We will use this table to train our model that can learn how similar two phrases are.
Now the next step is Tokenization, deep learning model needs number as their input, first into token and then those tokens into vectors, then we will feed those numbers into our model
Then we import pretrained NLP model from hugging face called  microsoft/deberta-v3-small.

Learneer from traanforer doeas everything etc

a pretrained model, thats been already fitted permieters, and some of the pparametrs are very cofident


Supervised learning means the data that has already the answeris and we want to predict the outcomes, based on that data we will predict the future outcomes. Labeled data= Upervised learning.

In classification we predict categories, classes, like cat or dog, email spam or not like that.
In Regression we predict a number, like contunues value, like the prices of this shoes will go up or down, a number, a contunoues value. 

tokens into nubmers is called numericilization\

Signs of Overfitting:
High accuracy on training set

Low accuracy on test set

Metric is like a accuracy, it tell you how good your model is. its liek a number.
