In this lesson wetext classification model (an nlp deep learning model that predict the similarity between phrases) with hugging face transformers. ( how similar the two phrases are in meaning.
Are they the same? Similar? Or totally different? )
First we load data set from kaggle
Then with panda df data frame we display data
We will use this table to train our model that can learn how similar two phrases are.
Now the next step is Tokenization, deep learning model needs number as their input, first into token and then those tokens into vectors, then we will feed those numbers into our model
Then we import pretrained NLP model from hugging face called  microsoft/deberta-v3-small.
