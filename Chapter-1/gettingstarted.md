All models need numbers as their input cuz machines works really workds with numbers

fastai is library is built upen on pytorch, so we use less code when using fastai library as compared to pytorch like:

Data Block: data block is a class from fast ai libraray for declaring yout full data pipe line at once

like blocks: inputs and targets, get_itmem how to list your data, aplitter = validatition,get_y lable folder name

Data loaders: data loader is a fast ai object which actually feed data to your model and for validation

Segmentation: in computer vision means dividing our image into specific parts like pixels

Collaborative filtering: we sue this method in recommmendation systems, like what user will warch next. in fastai library we can do this in few lines of codes..

Dalle 2 and midjourney etc used deep learning for genrating images

nueral networks is made up of nuerins that is attched to each other as layers, ist layers is input data, then between layers called hidden layers which holds raw data, 
and then final layer output.. each nueron hold different weights and it learns from each other...



Nueral  etwork is the made up of nuerons that is attached to each other as layers... ist layer is the input data, then between this there are hidden layers.



Classification: classification problem is a is problem whic hwe divide into categories.. It could be number or images or sound or any sort of input data , we can divide them intro categoreis, like model spam or nor not spam, tes or no... Basially a category .. It must chose one labee from fied set

Segmentation is classification but pixel level


Convolution: a specil nueral network for images..
WE use this because we look at all pixxels separtely.we use convolution, it has filters tha slides theough data and detect different patterns.
