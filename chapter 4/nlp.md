I learned about quadratic equations, slope,parabola. also will learn about derivatives as well tommorrow,
Goal is to learn about gradientdecent in this video
but first he shows us simple qudratic on a graph, then we change the values and the graph changes
we get the idea the nueral idea is controlled by its parametrs, like in qudratic we changes a,b,c.
we cretate maunual fitting slider, as shown in the pic. it shows by changing each coeffecnts how the curves bends just like tuning knobs until your model matchess the data.
a nueral network might have million of paramtters, so we cant tune them by heands, there where gradietn decent comes in,
the algortiham gradient decent which uses derivated (rates of change) to update parameters automatically.
we are learniong all this by noisy data.
after few other examples we will try gradient decent i guess.
struuggling bit in maths part, but i am looking into that alongside.
we pickeda shaped(model) model then set it to noisy data, then manually tweaked knobs by hands, then used mean abosulte error to calculate the loss instead of just guessing ,  then instead of by hands we automated this with gradient decent, and relu.
this video was a bit boring and tricky as well,
but in the next videos coming, we crate model from scratch and apply all these fuction and process live , so i will understand them more clealry and pratically. Becase this is the foundation.
